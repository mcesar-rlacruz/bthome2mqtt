#
# This file describes each BTHome v2 device to listen to and also the MQTT
#   brokers to where to publish their measurements. The data serialization
#   format used in this file is YAML, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML. 
#
# The program is able to (passively) listen and decode these BTHome v2
#   advertisements and, then, report the measured data to MQTT brokers. 
#   Authentication and encryption for these communications are supported.
#
# Each BTHome v2 device is identified by its MAC address, and the fields
#   describing each device are:
#       *   key:            mandatory for BTHome v2 devices encrypting their
#                               advertisements. It is a 128 bit hex number.
#       *   deduplicate:    a boolean (YAML booleans are true/yes/on and
#                               false/no/off) stating if repeated packets from
#                               the same device should be filtered or not. Some
#                               devices (e.g. a button reporting its "hold"
#                               event) may need not deduplication. Defaults to
#                               "on".
#       *   brokers:        an array of MQTT brokers where to publish
#                               measurements to. Will be described later.
#                           
#   For example:
#
# # my bthome device
# 11-22-33-44-55-66:                                    # device MAC address, case insensitive, can
#                                                           # use periods, colons, dashes, 
#                                                           # underscores, and spaces (use "" around
#                                                           # MAC in this last case)
#     key:            0123456789abcdef0123456789ABCDEF  # decryption key, case insensitive
#     deduplicate:    off                               # do not deduplicate repeated advertisements
#                                                           # from this device
#     brokers:                                          # required, to be described next
#
# Field "brokers" is an array describing all MQTT brokers to where to publish
#    to advertisements from each device. Each broker sub-fields are:
#       *   hostname:   the hostname of the broker (required).
#       *   port:       the port where the broker listens. Defaults to 8883.
#       *   user:       the user name, in case the broker needs authentication.
#       *   password:   the password, in case the broker needs authentication.
#       *   encrypt:    boolean (defaults to yes), set to use TLS.
#       *   insecure:   boolean (defaults to no), set in order to not check
#                           certificate hostname. Only used with encrypted
#                           clients. Useful when accessing brokers inside a LAN
#                           thru a 192.168.x.y address (or 127.0.0.1)
#       *   topics:     an array of MQTT topics where to publish the
#                           measurements. Required.
#
# Continuing with the previous example:
#
# # my bthome device
# 11-22-33-44-55-66:
#     key:              0123456789abcdef0123456789ABCDEF
#     deduplicate:      off
#     brokers:
#     -     hostname:   127.0.0.1
#           user:       my_user_name
#           password:   my_secret_password
#           insecure:   yes
#           topics:
#           -   bthome/exterior/temp
#           -   nodered/in
#     -     hostname:   my.mqtt.broker.xyz
#           port:       1883
#           user:       my_other_user_name
#           password:   my_other_secret_password
#           encrypt:    no
#           topics:
#           -   sensors/temp/exterior
#
#   will publish measurements from this device to 2 MQTT brokers:
#       # one at address 127.0.0.1, on port 8883, with the provided
#           authentication (user and password), using encryption, but not
#           checking the broker certificate hostname, and into 2 topics:
#           "bthome/exterior/temp" and "nodered/in"
#       # other at address my.mqtt.broker.xyz, on port 1883, with the provided
#           authentication (user and password), not using encryption and into
#           topic "sensors/temp/exterior"
#
# A "promiscuous" mode is supported. This mode is enabled defining a BTHome
#       device with field MAC address equal to "promiscuous". In this mode all
#       incoming BTHome advertisements coming from unlisted MAC addresses
#       are processed according to that "promiscuous" device AND the real MAC
#       address of the device is appended to the topics. Thus, defining device:
#
# promiscuous:
#     key:              FEDCBA9876543210fedcba9876543210
#     brokers:
#     -     hostname:   127.0.0.1
#           user:       another_more_user
#           password:   another_more_password
#           insecure:   yes
#           topics:     
#           -   nodered/promiscuous
#
#   will publish all advertisements from BTHome devices whose MAC is not listed
#   to broker at address 127.0.0.1, port 8883, with the provided credentials, 
#   using insecure encryption, into topic  "nodered/promiscuous/<MAC>", where
#   <MAC> is the MAC address (uppercase, without any separators) of such BTHome
#   devices.
#
# Finally, the format of this file, YAML, allows the use of "anchors" (&) and
#   "aliases" (*) that allow one to save some typing in case of repeated (even
#   with little variations) fields. Suppose, for example, that want to publish,
#   for a given device, the same information to two slightly different MQTT
#   brokers, then:
#
# # my bthome device
# 11-22-33-44-55-66:
#     key:              0123456789abcdef0123456789ABCDEF
#     brokers:
#     -     &mqtt_garden
#           hostname:   127.0.0.1
#           user:       my_user_name
#           password:   my_secret_password
#           insecure:   yes
#           topics:
#           -   bthome/exterior/temp
#     -     <<: *mqtt_garden
#           hostname:   192.168.0.101
#           topics:
#           -   nodered/in
#
#   will publish to 2 brokers, the description of the second one differing from
#   that of the 1st only in the hostname and topic.
#
# That's all, now put below the configuration for each of the desired BTHome
#   devices.
